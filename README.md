# HangMan Game 
This repository contains the implementation of a game of Hangman, a guessing game where one player selects a secret word and the other tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word, or the hangman is completed. This implementation of the game uses JavaFX, a popular Java library for building graphical user interfaces.
